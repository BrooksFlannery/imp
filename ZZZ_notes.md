- maybe better to generate mermaid and phases files using a bash script that parses analysis rather than rely on agents?(faster,cheaper, more reliable???)
- it seems like it is trying to have specifically 8 items in each phase. that is not what we are shooting for. we could have a wide range of items in phases. some phases may have 12 some may have 2...
- there is some mismatch in the way we name things. sometimes we use letter suffix based lettering sometimes we use plain numbers.
- test all imp.sh args
- can we make finish work with <plan-file> <phase> just to match better with other args
- can i have version be some value in a constants file so i can update it everywhere when i make a new version
- maybe automatically clean close active cursor tab when we call spawner?
- experiment with timings and try to speed things up
- some system to automatically check if spec has been updated when running imp? rn we need to delete imp-spec folder
- system only works with chats in panel view rn
